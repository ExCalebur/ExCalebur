# Hi, I'm Calen! :wave:

I'm looking to start a new career in Software Engineering and want to learn anything I can.

I've organized my profile into several sections:
- My [main profile repos](https://github.com/ExCalebur?tab=repositories)
  - these are completed projects that I've built
- Categorized Organizations
  - [Learning](https://github.com/ExCalebur-learning)
    - repos for learning specific subjects or previous school assignments
  - [Working](https://github.com/ExCalebur-working)
    - un-finished projects destined for my main page
  - [Forks](https://github.com/ExCalebur-forks)
    - forked repos used to reference or experiment
